In the year 2023, humanity made its most significant breakthrough in space travel. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, born on 07/15/1988, led the mission named "Abyss Beyond." On 23rd September, she and her team launched the spaceship "Endeavour" to explore the far reaches of the Milky Way.

The first diary entry from the spaceship was dated 09/24/2023. "It's a surreal experience," she wrote, "I remember when I was a little girl, staring at the stars on those summer nights of '95."

By 10/01/2023, the team had already passed Mars and were making their way towards Jupiter. On the way, they discovered a new comet on January 2nd, 2024, which they named "Rodriguez's Comet."

The spaceship received a message from Earth on 02-14-2024, Valentine's Day. It was a heartwarming message from children born on 5-5-2020, sending their love and hopes to the team.

By the time March 15, 2024 (03.15.2024) came around, the Endeavour had reached the outer planets. They marveled at the beauty of Saturn's rings and the mysterious dark spot of Neptune.

Dr. Rodriguez, in her log entry of Apr 5, 2024, mentioned a strange phenomenon. "The stars look different here. It's as if we're looking at a different sky entirely. I think back to my college days in the fall of 2007."

On the 8th of May, 2024, or as the ship's digital log stamped it, 05-08-2024, a critical system malfunction occurred. The team had to rely on their training from the rigorous sessions they had back in December, 2022.

June 21, 2024 was a day of celebration. Not only was it the summer solstice, but they also discovered a new exoplanet, which showed signs of life. The discovery was broadcasted back to Earth, and celebrations erupted worldwide on 22/06/2024.

As the Endeavour ventured further, on 07.30.2024, they encountered a wormhole. The next log entry, mysteriously dated 31-07-2025, described their experiences in an entirely different galaxy.

It wasn't until 08/15/2025 that Earth received another message from the Endeavour. They had made contact with an advanced civilization, and intergalactic diplomacy began.

The last message Earth received from Dr. Rodriguez was on September 1, 2025. "We've found a new home," she wrote, "I think of all those who supported this mission, especially my mother, born on 10.01.1960. We're making history."
